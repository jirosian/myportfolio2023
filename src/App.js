      <h1>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my coding journey!  <br/>I'm a Computer Science enthusiast with a solid foundation from Langara College, where I earned my Computer Science diploma. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        While C++ is my trusty companion, I'm not limited to just one language; I'm fluent in Java, JavaScript, React.js, and more. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        This portfolio showcases my adventures in coding, where I've combined my knowledge and curiosity to create innovative projects.
      
        <br/><br/>
        Additionally, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University, further fueling my quest for knowledge and excellence.</p>
